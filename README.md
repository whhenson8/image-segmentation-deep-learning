# image-segmentation-deep-learning
Based on the paper (to be published) - Automatic segmentation of lower limb muscles from MR images of post-menopausal women based on Deep Learning and data augmentation.

## Description
In this repository, three convolutional neural network architectures are implemented: the UNet, Attention UNet, and Spatial Channel UNet. 
1) UNet - Follows directly the paper by Ronneberger et al. 2015 (arXiv:1505.04597).
2) Att-UNet - Follows directly the paper by Oktay et al. 2018 (arXiv:1804.03999).
3) SC-UNet - Novel neural network architecture that combines imaging data and spatial data associated with medical images.
